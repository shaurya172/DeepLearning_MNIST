# DeepLearning_MNIST
Building a basic neural network to recognize digits from the MNIST Dataset.
Solving for this problem, and building out the layers of our neural network model is exactly what TensorFlow is for. 
TensorFlow is used for all things "operations on tensors."
A tensor in this case is nothing fancy. It's a multi-dimensional array.
